As you may know there is a new OS coming, it&#8217;s nothing special it&#8217;s just a striped linux(ubuntu) with a browser on top of it. Although it sounds small and stupid I think some people can benefit from it! <!--more-->I tried it my self in vmware and on an real laptop and I must say the concept is the same as for the thin clients but it works oke. This does not mean it is a bad idea, internet is growing and we keep seeing more and more online services. I truly believe some people could benefit from such OS but this is never going to be your mainstream OS. I am sure Google is not aiming at that either.
