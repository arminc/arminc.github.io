I was playing around with the Android sources lately. I followed the [androids][1] way of creating the workspace on you machine, although that works perfectly it's manual approach. So to make it a bit easier for you guys I just made a small script that can do all those steps for you. 

  
The script is meant for Ubuntu 9.04 32 bit. If you have any complains let me hear about it. BTW I will try to mess some more with the sources and with android so you may see more info in the near future. [DOWNLOAD][2]
