I thought I would explain why it is so quite on my blog lately. First I became sick for a weak and the other two weeks I was very very busy at work, lots of deadlines and production dates to catch. Right now I am in the finishing phase at work what means that we are almost done.

I have some nice topics I would like to write about but I think those will have to wait until next year. Next weak I am going on holiday and am back in the next year, that means no writhing but resting and enjoying.

I would like to wish everyone happy holidays and a happy new year, have fun enjoy the free time spend it well.
