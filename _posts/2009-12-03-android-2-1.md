The development of Android is going very fast. It&#8217;s not that long ago that Android 1.5 was released and HTC Hero was out. But we already have seen 1.6 getting released and 2.0 was released just since. But that is not the end of the story there is a leaked HTC Hero 2.1 circling around since couple of days. Some of the devs on xda are working on it to bring it out for testing. I think the release of the 2.1 at the moment is only for testing purposes and we need to wait a bit longer to see a full finished 2.1 for Hero. Never the less it&#8217;s fun to play around with new stuff.
