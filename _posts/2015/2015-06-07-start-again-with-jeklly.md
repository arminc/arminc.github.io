I have not blogged for quite some time now, I just had no fun with it anymore. But as I have done very cool things in the past two years I am actually sad that I haven’t shared my knowledge with the world. I still believe sharing is a way forward for all of us as this is how I learn on the internet as well. I have switched my blog from wordpress to jeklly hosted on github because it is fast and easy compared to the previous blog. I hope this will help me start blogging more even if they are quick posts.
