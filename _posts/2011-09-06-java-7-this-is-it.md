Java 7 was released, so I gave it a spin to see what kind of improvements were made. While testing some new features I went online to look for not so obvious changes as well. Here is a short list of the new features and improvements in Java 7.<!--more-->

  * Strings in switch 
  * try-with-resources statement 
  * More precise rethrow 
  * Multi-catch 
  * Binary integral literals 
  * Underscores in numeric literals 
  * Improved type inference for generic instance creation 
  * More new I/O APIs for the Java platform (NIO.2) 
  * Support for dynamic languages 
  * Better multicore and parallelism support 

The list is not that big but still it has some handy improvements. Looking at the list it struck me: How long have I been using Java 6? Looking at the table below you can see that Java has been updated every year or two but the gap between Java 6 and 7 is five years.

Time does not tell the whole story but looking at the time frame of five years it took to release Java 7 and the feature/improvement list it makes me say “This is it?” Sure Java 6 has been updated a lot but still it doesn&#8217;t fit. We all talk about Agile, iterative development and try to convince people how it improves software but when we need to improve a programming language we throw everything over board. But not all is lost, if you look at the table you can see that Java 8 is scheduled for 2012. So let me be optimistic and believe that this was just a hick up in the Java improvement process. 

I am looking forward to Java 8.
