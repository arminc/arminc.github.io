Couple of days ago I started to use an application Waze on my phone. You might think what is Waze so here it is:  
Waze is a social mobile application providing free turn-by-turn navigation based on the live conditions of the road. 100% powered by users, the more you drive, the better it gets. Join the community of drivers in your area today!<!--more-->

I think this has some potentials, free program, free information. That&#8217;s exactly how I look at it. It costs time and effort to build it up but once you have it and you have lot of users you will be able to predict your journey much more accurate than now. I don&#8217;t know if this tool is going to be successful but I do think it is a nice idea! On the other side who cares as long as you have fun, you can almost see this as an anonymous facebook for drives, it has even chitchat function when you are stuck on the road <img src='http://blog.coralic.nl/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
