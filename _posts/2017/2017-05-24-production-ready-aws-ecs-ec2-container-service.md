Are you looking to run Docker containers on AWS? Or are you looking to use AWS ECS (EC2 Container Service)? Does it need to be production ready?

If so, then speedup your process and be ready today by looking at my [GitHub repository on ECS](https://github.com/arminc/terraform-ecs). It contains infrastructure as code with Terraform for a quick production ready setup. But most importantly it contains information on how the infrastructure is setup. It explains why things are done in a certain way and where to watch for. And finally shows how to do simpel but fully automatic deployments.
