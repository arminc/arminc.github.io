My name is Armin Čoralić and I love technology, it’s my passion, my hobby and my work. I like to do a lot of different things so I end up creating mobile applications, hacking, testing software, messing around with operating systems, reading books, watching documentaries or any other thing I can think of.

I created this blog because I strongly believe in sharing knowledge. I am convinced that combining knowledge means we can accomplish greater things than trying to do everything on our own.
